    the weaktuple is a tuple with weakened immutability.
    
    the main difference betweek the two is that the weaktuple's immutability
    is only concerned with the size and the underlying type of each component.
    
    in other words, tuple's immutability property can be viewed as a set of
    three constraints C = (tupleSize, tupleComponentValue, tupleComponentType) (the
    third may be somehow implicit).

    The weaktuple's set of constraints has only two components:
    C = (tupleSize,tupleComponentType), equivalent to "tuple
    has a product type" if you like.

    component type, equivalent to "tuple has a product type" if you like.
    
    the values of weaktuple's component can be updated as long as the component's 
    type and tuple's size constraints are verified. 
    
    the weaktuple is not a 'hacked tuple' but a properly subclassed one. the
    tuple component update constraint is solved by adding one layer of indirection
    betweek the tuple implementation and the real object, a kind of proxy if you
    like (see impl)
    
    applicability: storing the arguments to a function  as a tuple for a
    later function call: while computing a set of conditions, the
    arguments may be needing updates. It's easier, clearer and hopefully faster to do an
    inplace tuple member update:
    
    >>> from subtypes.weaktuple import weaktuple
    >>> def f(p1,p2,p3):
    ...     print "called with: (%r,%r,%r)"%(p1,p2,p3)
    ... 
    >>> o=weaktuple([1,'abc',[(1,2),(1,3),(2,3)]])
    >>> o
    (1, 'abc', [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)])
    >>> f(*o)
    called with: (1,'abc',[(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)])
    >>> if issubclass(weaktuple,tuple): o[1]='cba'
    >>> f(*o)
    called with: (1,'cba',[(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)])
    >>> 
    >>> ###########################################
    ...
    >>> t1=weaktuple(range(1,4))
    #a weaktuple looks and feels like a normal tuple
    >>> t1
    (1, 2, 3)
    #and the developer gets back what he sent, not the wrapper types
    >>> map(type,t1)
    [<type 'int'>, <type 'int'>, <type 'int'>]
    >>> type(t1[1])
    <type 'int'>
    >>>
    >>>#however, you can see the real member type by calling base's __getitem__
    ...
    >>> type(tuple.__getitem__(t1,1))
    <class 'weaktuple.wrapped_int'>
    >>># when returned outside the tuple, the member is the type the developer expects
    ...# int type in this case
    >>> a=reduce(lambda x,y:x+y, t1)
    >>> a
    47
    >>> type(a)
    <type 'int'>
    >>> t1
    (1, 2, 44)
    #using a normal tuple like
    >>> t2=([1,2,44])
    >>> t2
    (1, 2, 44)
    #in relation with a weaktuple just works as expected:
    >>> t1 == t2
    True
    >>> type(t1)
    <class 'weaktuple.weaktuple'>
    >>> type(t2)
    <type 'tuple'>

    <type 'int'>
    <type 'int'>
    #although you can update the members, the tuple is still immutable
    #don't forget the subscript operator returns the wrapped type, not the wrapper
    >>> t2=weaktuple(range(1,10))
    >>> t2
    (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
    #see the wrapped object id before update
    >>> id(t2[4])
    9925336
    #and the wrapper id
    >>> id(tuple.__getitem__(t2,4))
    11413008
    #do the update
    >>> t2[4]=666
    >>> t2
    (1, 2, 3, 4, 666, 6, 7, 8, 9)
    #the wrapped object id changes
    >>> id(t2[4])

    #but the wrapper id remains the same
